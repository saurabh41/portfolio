    Stay humble. Although it’s important to include
     your accomplishments and your experience, do so 
     in a reasonable manner, avoiding outlandish statements.
      Declarations like, “I’m the best marketing professional 
      there is” or “Any company that brings me on board is lucky
       to have me” will certainly hurt you more than it will help you get hired.

       You won’t be introducing yourself in the same way you would be to, say, 
       someone you’ve just met in a bar, but you also shouldn’t sound like a politician 
       running for president. Use a tone pitch you should use for networking. Also, be 
       honest about your interests and goals.
